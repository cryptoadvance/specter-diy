# Build

Clone the repository recursively `git clone https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-diy.git --recursive`

`bootloader` folder contains a [secure bootloader](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-bootloader) that you can customize with your own firmware signing keys.

## Prerequisities

### Nix shell

The easiest way to get all necessary tools is to run `nix-shell` from the root of the repository. You need to have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed.

### Prerequisities: Board

To compile the firmware for the board you will need `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi gdb-multiarch openocd
```

#### Archlinux

```sh
sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-binutils openocd base-devel python-case
```
You might need change default gcc flag settings with `CFLAGS_EXTRA="-w"`. Export it or set the variable before of `make`
to avoid warnings being raised as errors.

#### MacOS

```sh
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

#### Windows

Install the Linux subsystem and follow Linux instructions. The recommended distribution as of this writing is **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.  It can be installed using the following command in the **administrator's PowerShell**:

```sh
# Install Ubuntu 22.04 as WSL Linux environment
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
# Start new instance of Ubuntu 22.04 (if multiple distros are present in system)
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04
```

To install all the dependencies on Windows, make sure the **universe** repository is enabled and the package list is up to date. If not, here is a quick fix:

```sh
# Uncomment all lines in /etc/apt/sources.list that begin with # deb
sudo sed -i 's/^# deb/deb/' /etc/apt/sources.list
# Enable universe repository
sudo add-apt-repository universe
# Update package list
sudo apt update
```

### Prerequisities: Simulator

You may need to install SDL2 library to simulate the screen of the device.

#### Linux

```sh
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

#### MacOS

```sh
brew install sdl2
```

To make the SDL2 library available to your C/C++ toolchain, ensure that Homebrewâ€™s include and library paths are added to the compiler and linker flags. If they are not already set, you can add the following lines to your shell profile (commonly `~/.zprofile` or `~/.bash_profile`) or configure them in another way before making the Unix build:

```sh
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/lib $LDFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS="-idirafter /opt/homebrew/include $CPPFLAGS"
export CFLAGS="-idirafter /opt/homebrew/include $CFLAGS"
```

#### Windows

- `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev` on Linux side.
- install and launch [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) on Windows side
- set `export DISPLAY=:0` on linux part

[VcXsrv](https://github.com/marchaesen/vcxsrv) is another viable option for running X11 applications on Windows. Here is an example environment that should be configured on the WSL side:

```sh
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true
export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/mnt/wslg/runtime-dir
```

## Build

To build custom bootloader and firmware that you will be able to sign check out the bootloader doc on [self-signed firmware](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-bootloader/blob/master/doc/selfsigned.md). To wipe flash and remove protections on the device with the secure bootloader check out [this doc](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-bootloader/blob/master/doc/remove_protection.md).

To build an open firmware (no bootloader and signature verifications) run `make disco`. The result is the `bin/specter-diy.bin` file that you can copy-paste to the board over miniUSB.

To build a simulator run `make unix` - it will compile a micropython simulator for mac/unix and store it under `bin/micropython_unix`.

To launch a simulator either run `bin/micropython_unix simulate.py` or simly run `make simulate`.

If something is not working you can clean up with `make clean`

## Run Unittests

Currently unittests work only on linuxport, and there are... not many... Contributions are very welcome!

```
make test
```
