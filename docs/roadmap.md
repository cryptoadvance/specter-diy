# Roadmap for Specter-DIY development

Security critical features:

- optional secure bootloader checking signatures on the firmware
- secure poweroff that erases all the secrets from RAM
- moving device secret to the very beginning of the flash or even to the bootloader
- add tests, fuzzing etc
- optimize the code

Documentation:

- firmware protection instructions with tools from STM

Would be nice to add:

- Devkit (WIP)
