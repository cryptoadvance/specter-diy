# Installing the compiled code

* Connect the DISCO board to your computer via the **miniUSB** cable on the top of the board.
    * The board should appear as a removable disk named DIS_F469NI.
* Go the Releases section of this github repo.
* Download the `specter-diy.bin` file from the latest release.
* Copy the bin file into the root of the DISCO filesystem.
* When the board is done loading the bin the board will reset itself and begin running the Specter firmware.
* First you will be asked to set up the PIN code for your device that will be used to protect your files together with a unique secret generated on the first boot.
