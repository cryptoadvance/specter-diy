# Specter DIY Snap Case

![](../../pictures/gallery/snap-case-bronze-black-1.jpg)

Specter DIY Snap Case is a print it yourself snap case with the waveshare scanner on the backside. It consists of a middle part, in which the camera is held and the cables are fixed, and an upper and a lower part, which can be plugged together. 

## Please note

The prints are quite tight around the hardware components. They are well tested with a Prusa MK3s and Specter hardware components from late 2022. Other printers or newer or older hardware may produce results that do not fit. Please check carefully that the prints do not exert pressure on any hardware components and don't exert any pressure yourself.
