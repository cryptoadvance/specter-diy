# Enclosures for Specter-DIY

There are a few case designs made by the community:

## SeedSigner's "Barebones" enclosure, v2

Updated design from @SeedSigner (Twitter/Telegram) with a smaller form factor & MicroSD access.

The printable .STL files are available for purchase for 20,000 sats (contact him directly, currently ~$7, price in sats will be adjusted as the dollar collapses against Bitcoin).

Barebones v1 is available for download from the docs/enclosures/seedsigner folder or from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4680700).

You can also buy the v2, or a fully assembled Specter-DIY, from [his shop](https://btc-hardware-solutions.square.site/).
