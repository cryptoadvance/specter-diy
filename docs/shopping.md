# Shopping list for Specter-DIY

## Discovery board

Main part of the device is the developer board:

- STM32F469I-DISCO developer board (i.e. from [Mouser](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/STM32F469I-DISCO?qs=kWQV1gtkNndotCjy2DKZ4w==) or [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/STM32F469I-DISCO/497-15990-ND/5428811))
- **Mini**USB cable (for example [this](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Omron-Automation-and-Safety/USB-MINIUSB?qs=sGAEpiMZZMt93J8DTi5DC6y9EQiX1Vkv))

For the rest of the components we are currently working on [a devkit](../devkit) that includes a smartcard slot, QR code scanner, battery and a 3d printed case, but it doesn't include the main part â€” discovery board that you need to order separately. This way supply chain attack is still not an issue as the security-critical components are bought from random electronic store.

## QR scanner

For QR code scanner you have several options.

**Option 1.** Resonably good scanner from Waveshare (40$)

- [Waveshare scanner](https://www.waveshare.com/barcode-scanner-module.htm) - you will need to find a way how to mount it nicely, maybe use some kind of Arduino Prototype shield and some ducktape. For wiring see [here](docs/waveshare.md).

**Option 2.** Extremely nice scanner from Mikroe but pretty expensive (150$):

- [Barcode Click](https://www.mikroe.com/barcode-click) + [Adapter](https://www.mikroe.com/arduino-uno-click-shield)

## Optional components

If you add a battery & power charger/booster then your wallet becomes completely self-contained ;)
